## Ⅰ. Introduction

### Background

"Taisite-Platform" is an interface automation test platform developed by "Software Testing & Machine Learning Enthusiasts".

### Vision

The platform is dedicated to effectively combining artificial intelligence technology with software testing, enabling 
the platform to be more intelligent and generalized while ensuring test accuracy requirements
and **optimize the user experience** at the same time. The goal is to become the most intimate, best-used, 
highest value open source test platform.
 
### Technology stack

The platform follows the idea of "separate development frontend and backend". The technology stack is: "Python + Vue + Mongodb".

### User environment

**Chrome is a good choice**

### Open source protocol

***APGL-3.0***


## Ⅱ. Taisite-platform features (os: What is the difference between other test platforms?)

 **0. It has been put into production environment for more than 1 year, it is stable~**
 
 1. The platform follows a "small but fine" strategy to maximize the development of all features and cost-effectiveness, helping test teams quickly build easy-to-follow/maintain interfaces
  automated test system.
 
 2. The platform follows the "zero-encoding" principle, and users can complete more complex business process interface tests without programming.
 
 3. The platform follows the principle of “good-looking is justice” and the operation interface is shown as follows:
